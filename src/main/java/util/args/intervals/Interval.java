/**
 * An interval within a naturally ordered type. The natural order is defined by
 * the <code>compareTo</code> method of the type.
 * <p>
 * An interval has a lower endpoint and an upper endpoint, each having a value
 * of the type which forms the basis of the interval, and each having a mode of
 * either open or closed. An interval includes all values which are permitted by
 * <strong>both</strong> the lower <strong>and</strong> upper endpoints. A
 * closed lower endpoint permits all values which are greater-than-or-equal-to
 * the lower endpoint value; an open lower endpoint permits all values which are
 * greater than the lower endpoint value. A closed upper endpoint permits all
 * values which are less-than-or-equal-to the upper endpoint value; an open
 * upper endpoint permits all values which are less than the upper endpoint
 * value.</p>
 * <p>
 * If an endpoint is <code>null</code> then it means there is no limit to what
 * is included in that direction. So a <code>null</code> lower endpoint means
 * that all values permitted by the upper endpoint are included in the interval;
 * a <code>null</code> upper endpoint means that all values permitted by the
 * lower endpoint are included in the interval; and if both endpoints are
 * <code>null</code> then all values are included in this interval. Note that
 * <code>null</code> itself is never included in an interval, as a null object
 * represents the lack of a value. Be aware that null endpoints will allow any
 * value of the permitted type, including values such as <code>Double.NaN</code>
 * (which is supposed to represent a non-value value).</p>
 * <p>
 * Also note that a type constant which is intended to represent infinity, such
 * as <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code>, is just another numeric value so
 * far as the <code>Comparable</code> interface is concerned, and is therefore
 * just another member of the naturally ordered set Double so far as
 * <code>Interval&lt;Double&gt;</code> is concerned. Specifying such a value for
 * an endpoint is not the same as specifying <code>null</code> because
 * <code>null</code> will admit any value belonging to the interval basis type,
 * whereas a pseudo-infinite value such as <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code>
 * will exclude any values which are beyond it in the natural order of the basis
 * type. For example, <code>Double.NaN</code> is considered greater than
 * <code>Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</code> and also greater than
 * <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code> according to the <code>compareTo</code>
 * method of <code>Double</code>.</p>
 * <p>
 * An implementation of <code>Interval</code> may or may not permit
 * <code>null</code> endpoint values, and it must make clear in its
 * documentation what is permitted.</p>
 * <p>
 * An interval can include zero, one or both of its endpoint values. This is
 * specified by the mode of each endpoint. {@link EndpointMode#CLOSED} means
 * that the endpoint value itself is permitted by the endpoint, while
 * {@link EndpointMode#OPEN} means that the endpoint value itself is not
 * permitted by the endpoint. For instance, an
 * <code>Interval&lt;Double&gt;</code> might have a lower endpoint value of zero
 * and a lower endpoint mode of <code>EndpointMode.OPEN</code> which means that
 * zero is the lower limit of the interval but is not included in the interval.
 * The endpoint mode is irrelevant for a null endpoint.</p>
 * <p>
 * An implementation of <code>Interval</code> may permit both open and closed
 * endpoints, or may permit only one mode, and it must make the options clear in
 * its documentation.</p>
